The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID, initialCredit).
• Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is
customerID.
• Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.
• Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts.


1- 1st step run the solution, make sure the API project is the startup poject
2- open it with swagger to easly see all APIs, you can only put swagger at the end 
   like ( swagger/index.html )
3- you can use any API u want, I make a fake data in project called Memory
